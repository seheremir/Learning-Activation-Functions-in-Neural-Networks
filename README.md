# Learning Activation Functions in Neural Networks

This repository presents an experimental study on **learning and adapting activation functions in neural networks**, instead of relying on fixed, manually chosen activations such as ReLU, Tanh, or Sigmoid.

The project investigates whether neural networks can **learn their own activation behavior** during training and how this affects performance, stability, and generalization across different experimental settings.

## Notebook

The main experimental workflow is implemented in the following Jupyter notebook:

- `aktivasyon_fonk_tahmini.ipynb`

The notebook is designed to run on **Google Colab** and contains:
- Model definitions
- Adaptive activation mechanisms
- Training and evaluation loops
- Automatic result logging and visualization
